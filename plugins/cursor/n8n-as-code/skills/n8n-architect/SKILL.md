# n8n Architect

Use this skill only for explicit n8n workflow work.

## Operating model

This plugin is installed globally in Cursor. Instance and credential state is global in n8n-manager, while project and sync-folder context is resolved for the active workspace.

- Each workspace that should sync workflows must be initialized independently.
- n8n-manager is the source of truth for instances and API keys. The active workspace owns only `n8nac-config.json` overrides, `AGENTS.md`, and local workflow files.
- Do not assume that because the plugin is globally available, the current workspace is already initialized.

## Tool priority

Prefer tools in this order:

1. Use `n8n-manager` for global n8n instance/auth/project management. Use `n8nac workspace` for workspace-local overrides. Use `n8nac` workflow commands for list, pull, push, resolve, verify, test, credential management, and execution inspection.
2. After initialization, read `AGENTS.md` from the workspace root and treat it as the detailed workflow-engineering protocol for that specific workspace.
3. Use the bundled MCP server only for knowledge lookups or validation fallback when that is more direct than the CLI. Do not rely on MCP for workspace mutations.

## Workspace bootstrap

Before using any workflow command, check whether the workspace is initialized.

### Initialization check

- Look for `n8nac-config.json` at the root of the target workspace.
- If `n8nac-config.json` is missing, or it exists but does not contain a selected project context, the workspace is not initialized yet.
- Never ask the user to run setup commands themselves. You are the agent and must run them.
- Use `n8n-manager instances list` to inspect existing global instances.
- Use `n8n-manager instances select <id-or-name>` to reuse an existing global instance.
- If credentials are needed, run `n8n-manager auth set --url <url> --api-key-stdin`.
- Discover projects with `n8n-manager projects list` and select the instance default with `n8n-manager projects select <project-id-or-name>`.
- Configure workspace-local sync with `npx --yes n8nac workspace set-sync-folder workflows`.
- Configure a workspace project override only when needed with `npx --yes n8nac workspace set-project --project-id <id> --project-name <name>`.
- Never write `n8nac-config.json` by hand.

### Required order

1. Check for `n8nac-config.json`.
2. If global n8n-manager instances exist, inspect them with `n8n-manager instances list`.
3. If initialization is missing and credentials are available, run `n8n-manager auth set`, inspect projects, then run `n8n-manager projects select` and `npx --yes n8nac workspace set-sync-folder workflows`.
4. If credentials are missing, ask the user for the n8n host URL and API key, then run the commands yourself.
5. After initialization, read `AGENTS.md` before making workflow changes.

## Sync discipline

This project uses a Git-like explicit sync model.

### Before modifying a workflow

Always pull first:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac pull <workflowId>
```

### After modifying a workflow

Always push the local file back to n8n:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac push <path-to-workflow>
npx --yes n8nac push <path-to-workflow> --verify
```

### Conflict handling

If push fails with an OCC conflict:

- Inspect the workflow state with `npx --yes n8nac list --json`.
- Resolve explicitly with:
  - `npx --yes n8nac resolve <workflowId> --mode keep-current`
  - `npx --yes n8nac resolve <workflowId> --mode keep-incoming`
- Never overwrite remote changes blindly.

## Research protocol

Never guess node parameters.

### Preferred lookup path

If CLI access is available, use:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac skills search "http request"
npx --yes n8nac skills node-info "httpRequest"
npx --yes n8nac skills validate workflow.workflow.ts
```

If the MCP tools are available and it is more convenient, use them for the same knowledge tasks:

- `search_n8n_knowledge`
- `get_n8n_node_info`
- `search_n8n_workflow_examples`
- `get_n8n_workflow_example`
- `search_n8n_docs`
- `validate_n8n_workflow`

Use MCP for lookup and validation. Use CLI for sync and runtime operations.

## Reading workflow files efficiently

Every `.workflow.ts` file starts with a `<workflow-map>` block. Read that first before opening the rest of the file.

1. Read `<workflow-map>` only.
2. Locate the property name you need.
3. Search that property name in the file.
4. Read only that section instead of the whole workflow.

## Coding standards

### TypeScript decorator format

```typescript
import { workflow, node, links } from '@n8n-as-code/transformer';

@workflow({
  name: 'Workflow Name',
  active: false,
})
export class MyWorkflow {
  @node({
    name: 'Descriptive Name',
    type: 'httpRequest',
    version: 4,
    position: [250, 300],
  })
  MyNode = {
    // Parameters must come from schema lookup.
  };

  @links()
  defineRouting() {
    this.MyNode.out(0).to(this.NextNode.in(0));
  }
}
```

### AI node wiring

- Regular data flow uses `.out(0).to(target.in(0))`.
- AI sub-nodes must use `.uses()`.
- `ai_tool` and `ai_document` are arrays.
- Other AI connection types are single refs.

## Testing and credentials

After pushing:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac test-plan <workflowId>
npx --yes n8nac workflow credential-required <workflowId> --json
npx --yes n8nac credential schema <type>
npx --yes n8nac credential create --type <type> --name "<name>" --file cred.json --json
npx --yes n8nac workflow activate <workflowId>
npx --yes n8nac test <workflowId> --prod
```

If a workflow still looks broken after a successful webhook call, inspect executions:

```bash
npx --yes n8nac execution list --workflow-id <workflowId> --limit 5 --json
npx --yes n8nac execution get <executionId> --include-data --json
```

## Response rules

- Check initialization first.
- Use CLI as the default runtime and mutation interface.
- Read `AGENTS.md` after initialization and follow it as workspace-specific guidance.
- Use MCP for lookup and validation when helpful, not as the primary mutation path.
- Pull before editing. Push after editing.
- Never hallucinate node names, parameters, or CLI flags.
