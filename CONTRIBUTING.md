# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to n8n-as-code!

## How to contribute

- **Bug reports** — Open an issue describing what happened and how to reproduce it
- **Feature requests** — Open an issue describing what you'd like and why
- **Code** — Fork the repo, make your changes, open a pull request

For detailed contribution guides (architecture, CLI, VS Code extension, Skills…), see the **[Contribution docs](https://n8nascode.dev/docs/contribution)**.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Dependency maintenance

```bash
# Update all published n8n-manager runtime dependencies to their latest versions
npm run update:n8n-manager
```

This command rewrites matching workspace `package.json` files and refreshes the root workspace install.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one thing at a time
- Write tests if you're adding new behavior
- Don't worry too much about formatting, CI will catch style issues
- All pull requests must target the `next` branch as base

That's it. No CLA, no bureaucracy.
