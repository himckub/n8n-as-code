# n8n-as-code V2

**n8n-as-code** is the n8n workspace for AI agents. It lets you build, edit, sync, deploy, test, and debug workflows from local files while staying connected to a real n8n instance.

The recommended path is the VS Code/Cursor extension. It includes the editor-specific experience: an n8n sidebar, embedded workflow UI, and integrated Agent Workbench.

## What V2 Adds

- **Integrated VS Code/Cursor Agent** that works with the current workflow, selected node, active instance, selected project, and local workspace.
- **`n8n-manager` runtime layer** for instance registration, API keys, managed local n8n, project selection, credentials, activation, execution, and inspection.
- **Grounded n8n knowledge** from bundled schemas, docs, examples, templates, snippets, and validation rules.
- **Explicit Git-like sync** so pull, push, resolve, and conflict decisions stay reviewable.
- **One workflow loop** from idea to file edit to n8n deployment to execution debugging.

## How It Works

1. **Choose an n8n runtime**: create a managed local n8n instance or connect an existing n8n Cloud/self-hosted instance.
2. **Bind the workspace**: select the n8n project and local sync folder.
3. **Work locally**: pull workflows, create new files, open the canvas, and commit changes with Git.
4. **Use the Agent**: ask it to build, refactor, explain, validate, or fix workflows with live context.
5. **Ship intentionally**: push changes, provision missing credentials, activate, run supported workflows, and inspect executions.

## Choose Your Entry Point

| If you use... | Start here |
|---|---|
| **VS Code / Cursor** | [VS Code Extension](/docs/usage/vscode-extension) - the full V2 Agent Workbench and visual workflow workspace |
| **Terminal / CI** | [CLI](/docs/usage/cli) - explicit sync, validation, AI context generation, and automation |
| **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** | [Claude Plugin](/docs/usage/claude-plugin) - n8n skills and MCP-backed workflow work in Claude environments |
| **Generic coding agents** | [Skills Reference](/docs/usage/skills) - portable n8n skills packaged as `@n8n-as-code/skills` |
| **OpenClaw** | [OpenClaw Plugin](/docs/usage/openclaw) - portable n8n skills and setup inside OpenClaw |
| **Runtime setup** | [n8n-manager](/docs/usage/n8n-manager) - instances, credentials, managed runtimes, deployment, execution, and inspection |

## Quick Start

Install the VS Code extension, open the `n8n` view, run `n8n: Configure`, and select how you want to use n8n:

```text
[Recommended] Create and manage a local n8n automatically
[Connect an existing n8n]
[Use generation-only mode]
```

After the workspace context is saved, pull an existing workflow or create a new one. Then ask the Agent for the workflow change you want, for example:

```text
Create a workflow that receives a webhook, validates the payload, stores it in Google Sheets, and sends a Slack alert when validation fails.
```
